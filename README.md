## Background & Objectives

In this challenge, there are two parts to build in the same Stimulus controller:

- get all the cars from the garage API and display it on the cars-list
- add a car to the garage API and refresh the cars-list display

### Setup

Let's launch a local webserver by running:

```bash
serve
```

Then, open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

### Stimulus setup

Stimulus package URL is already set in `importmap` in the `index.html`.
Stimulus is already imported and initialized in `app.js` for you.


### Stimulus controller

The `garage_controller.js` file is already created for you in the `controllers` folder

Put the `data-controller` attribute at the right place in the HTML. It should be on an HTML element (div or other) that encapsulate every HTML part that we want to handle with Javascript.

### Get all the cars

Get all the cars from the garage API and display it on the cars-list

### Add a car

Add a car to the garage API and refresh the cars-list display

Good luck!!
